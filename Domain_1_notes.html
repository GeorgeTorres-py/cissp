<body>
-Security refers to the protection of information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
-Security measures are designed to prevent attacks or breaches that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information or system.
-Security Measures may include physical and technical safe guards, access controls, encryption, and monitoring.

<b><h3></h2> The C.I.A Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)</b></h2>
<b>Confidentiality:</b> Is the protection of the secrecy of data, objects, or resources.
  
<b>Integrity:</b> Protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Integrity protection prevents
 unautorized alterations of data. 

<b>Availability:</b> Authorized subjects are granted uninterrupted and timely access to objects.

<b>Non-Repudiation:</b> unable to deny an incident occured. It can be established by issuing session identifiers, digital certificates, transaction logs,
  and many other access control mechanisms.

<h3><b>D.A.D Triad:</h3></b> Represents failures of security protections in the CIA Triad.

<b>Disclosure:</b>Occurs when sensitive or confidential material is accessed by unauthorized
  entities
<b>Alteration:</b> Occurs when data is accedentially or maliciously altered.
<b>Destruction:</b> Occurs when a resource is damaged or made inaccessable to authorized
  users. Destruction is a violation of availablity.

-Identification
-Authentication
-Authorization
-Auditing
-Accounting
  </h3>
<b>Identification:</b> A subject must perform identification to start the IAAA process. Providing an identity can involve a username,
  swiping a smart car, speaking a phrase, face ID, fingerprint...etc

<b>Authentication:</b> The proccess of verifying whether a claimed identity is valid. Authentication requires a subject to provide additional information that corresponds
  to the identity that they are claiming. The most common form of authentication is a password.

<b>Authorization:</b> Once the identified subject is authenticated, they must then be authorized. The process of authoriztion ensures that the requested
  activity or access to an object is possible, based on the rights and priviliges assined to that user. 


<b>Auditing</b> A subjects actions are tracked and recorded to hold a subject accountable for their actions while authenicated. Auditing is recording the activities of a subject and its objects and the activities of an application
  and system functions.

<b>Accounting:</b> A organizations security policy can be properly enforced only if accounting is maintained. Effective Accounting relies on the capability to prove a subjects identity and track their activities.

<b>Defense in Dept:</b> Also known as <i>Layering</i> is the use of multuple controls in a series. Using a multilayered solution allows for numerous different controls to guard against multiple threats.
-Terms used in the context of defense in dept: Levels, Multi-level, Layers, Calssifications, Zones, Realms, Compartments, Silos, Segmentations, Lattuce Structures, and Protection rings.

<b>Abstraction:</b> is used for effenciency. Similar events are put into groups, classes, or roles that are collectively assigned security controls, restrictions, and permissions. Abstraction simplifies security by enabling you
  to assign security roles to a group of objects collected by type or function.

<b>Data Hiding:</b> Data hiding is preventing data from being discovered by a subject by positioning the data in a logical storage compartment that is not accessible nor seen by the subject. This is a vital characteristic in 
  multi-level secure systems.

<b>Encryption:</b> Hiding the meaning or intent of a communication from unintended recipients.

<b>Security Boundary:</b> is the line of intersection between areas, subnets, or enviorments. The distinction between classifications is a security boundary. Security boundaries should always be clearly defined.

<b>Third Party Governance:</b> is the system of external entity oversight that may be mandated by law, regulation, industry standards, contractual obligation, or licensing.
  Another aspect of Third party governance is the application of security oversight to third parties that your organization relies on. Third party governance focuses on verifying compliance with
  stated security objectives, requirements, regulations and contractual obligations.

<b>Security Function:</b> is the aspect of running a business that focuses on the task of evaluating and improving security over time. The act of performing a risk assesment to drive the security policy is the clearest and most direct
  example of managment of the security function. Security must be measurable. Managing the securoty function includes the development and implementation of information security strategies. 
  
<b>Security Managment Planning:</b> Ensures the proper creation, implementation, and enforcment of a <i>security policy.</i> Security managment planning aligns the security functions to the strategy, goals, missions, and objectives
  of the prganization.

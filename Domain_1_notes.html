<b><h3></h2> The C.I.A Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)</b></h2>
<b>Confidentiality:</b> Is the protection of the secrecy of data, objects, or resources.
  
<b>Integrity:</b> Protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Integrity protection prevents
 unautorized alterations of data. 

<b>Availability:</b> Authorized subjects are granted uninterrupted and timely access to objects.

<b>Non-Repudiation:</b> unable to deny an incident occured. It can be established by issuing session identifiers, digital certificates, transaction logs,
  and many other access control mechanisms.

<h3><b>D.A.D Triad:</h3></b> Represents failures of security protections in the CIA Triad.
</body>
<b>Disclosure:</b>Occurs when sensitive or confidential material is accessed by unauthorized
  entities
<b>Alteration:</b> Occurs when data is accedentially or maliciously altered.
<b>Destruction:</b> Occurs when a resource is damaged or made inaccessable to authorized
  users. Destruction is a violation of availablity.

<b>Identification:</b> A subject must perform identification to start the IAAA process. Providing an identity can involve a username,
  swiping a smart car, speaking a phrase, face ID, fingerprint...etc

<b>Authentication:</b> The proccess of verifying whether a claimed identity is valid. Authentication requires a subject to provide additional information that corresponds
  to the identity that they are claiming. The most common form of authentication is a password.

<b>Authorization:</b> Once the identified subject is authenticated, they must then be authorized. The process of authoriztion ensures that the requested
  activity or access to an object is possible, based on the rights and priviliges assined to that user.
